# Resources

Resources are the backbone of the city building and classed into 2 different categories.

## Essential Resources

Essential resources such as wood and plant-based food are in infinite supply on the map.

### Wood

- is gathered from trees
- trees from from sapling which spawn near other trees



## Luxury Resources

Luxury resources are valuable but finite. They can be either limited such as stone form a quarry, disruptable such as a population of deer, or only appear with random events such as goods from a travelling merchant.



## Resource Processing

Resources can be processed in buildings. For example, making wood planks out of raw wood or flour out of wheat.

Processing resources enables the resource to be used in different ways compared to its prior form. In general, processed resources cannot be found in the wild and must be refined from raw materials. Processing luxury resources makes them even more valuable.
