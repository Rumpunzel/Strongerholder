# Ghost Prototype

## Situation

Everyone is dead.

And has unfinished business. Also they are in denial about being dead. You are the only aware of your untimely demise.

Make the best of your situation.



## End Goal

Resolve everyone else's unfinished business.

*Resolve your own unfinished business.*

### Noteworthy Characters

There are a number of noteworthy deceased people. They have major quest lines.

The completion of these quest lines, one way or the other, contributes meaningfully towards the effort of business resolution, which is: 

### Unresolved Business

Everyone has a dream of what they would like to be.

Solve this problem through the magic of consumerism. Someone wanted to be a knight? Fashion a knightly armour and ceremony for them. (Basically game is just radiant quests of gather stuff to turn it into fancy stuff with eldritch magic). Also maybe someone might miss their brother. Learn some dark magic, find his corpse, and bring him back for a reunion.

### Granting Wishes vs. The Motherland

Resolving someone's wishes, grants them passage into the afterlife (or not, no idea, you're not a theologian). But that means fewer hands (not that ghost have hands) to work in the fact...I mean paradise.

Until resolving the business of the first noteworthy character, everyone leaves after having their business resolved, though that character choses to stay cause a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. After that, more ghost will stay in addition to those finding their way to the city, and make it a nicer place for ghostkind. A character whose business has been resolved, no longer gain insanity, though because of that, they might chose to spend a day at the lake instead of working every now and then.

### Eldritch Magic

To progress, you need components for your spells. The main uses for these spells are:

- Resolving unfinished business (basically radiant quests)
- Exploring the wilderness (light, maybe combat spells, breaking seals)
- Summoning new structures
- Maybe temporary boni (like making trees or crops grow)

*? Your spells cause you insanity to use. This raises two questions: ?*

- *What are the effects of having insanity? (maybe turning friendly things hostile, having some other weird effects; see Don't Starve)*
- *How does one decrease one's insanity? (by taking leisurely strolls through nature)*



## Failure Condition

Every ghost has an insanity score.

Going above a certain insanity level, turns the ghost into a hostile monster.

### Sanity

Not doing stuff, contemplating, increasing insanity. So keeping the ghosts busy is vital. Hostile living conditions also increase insanity, while nice, calming things decrease it.

Should the player also have insanity, gaining too much of that is obviously also a failure condition.
