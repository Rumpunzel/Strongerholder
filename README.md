# Strongerholder



## Elevator Pitch

*Strongerholder is a calm, sandboxy, sidescrolling castle-sim where you build a ringed city with the refugees of a great war; explore to expand.*

### Influences

- Stronghold Series
- Kingdom Series
- Frostpunk



## Victory Conditions

Victory Conditions are picked mid-game by building a special landmark in the middle of the map. Each of those buildings has a unique challenge to fulfill to win the game.

Design goal of the Victory Conditions is to create a diverse array of play patterns by incentivizing different strategies.

- Non-time based as far as possible
- Between 1 to 3 stages (e.g. gather X of Y resource; or, upgrade X, then reach population Y, and then survive raid)
- Upgrades of the landmark can be non-linear



## Random Events

There are semi-random events which occur during gameplay with the intention of diversifying gameplay patterns further.

### Characters

After picking the starting character, further characters can be found in the world or will join the city. The generation of new characters is semi-random. Each character has 2 different roles they can occupy. Each role changes their effect on the city and influences their personal story. For further information, see the Characters design document.

### Incidents

In addition, random events will happen based on the players decisions and city planing (e.g. focusing on selling beer in inns may cause a bar brawl, attract a character of renown, or simply increase the marriage rate).
