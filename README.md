## Level Design

### Atmosphere

- As a baseline, the world is peaceful and calm
- Technology is not very advanced, facilitating the need for manual labor in individual steps which can be observed
- The general feeling shall be very down-to-earth and in the moment
  - The player and each NPC is part of the city and working together to make it work
  - There is a bigger emphasis of making it right than making it fast
- The surrounding area can be explored and expanded into; it hides secrets and conflict

### Structure

- The world is comprised of cities
- Each city consists of multiple rings encircling the center
- Each ring is practically its down 2-dimensional level with all the levels of each city existing in parallel
- Traveling between rings is done by bridges which connect two rings
- The entire structure exists in 3-dimensional space while using the optical illusion tricks of 2-dimensional space to seem bigger than it truly is
