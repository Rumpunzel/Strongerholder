# Characters

## Purpose of having Characters

- The setting wants to be intimate on a personal level. For actions, this constraint also already fulfilled with the design of the resource loops. Providing somewhat of an insight into thoughts and feelings would be a great asset, though doing so for each individual person is practically impossible.
- So instead using a handful of named characters actually enables the possibility to represent the facets, thoughts, and feelings of the community.
- This can also contribute a decent amount to replayability when each character has a unique personal storyline to experience and the game allows the player to pick from the array of characters at the start.
- Adding onto that would be unique abilities for each character to further distinguish different playthroughs.
- On top of that, it would diversify the coop experience, should coop be implemented.



## The Craftsman

### Abilities

- **Eye for Detail:** Resources being foraged around them have a chance to also drop gold.
- **Strong Back:** Increased inventory space.



## The Innkeep

Will run the inn built in the town. What more would you even need to know to confirm that this is the best character?



## The Knight

An imposing figure with a booming voice and presence clad in armour from head to toe.

### Personal Story

Died in the war but their spirit was bound to their armour by a priestess they in turn failed to protect when her time came. Having found unprecedented resolve after losing a dear friend they still owed a life-debt, they now try to live a life worth two in honour of their late friend.

Has to come to terms with the fact that the torch which burns brightest, burns fastest. Especially when burning for the departed and not for itself.

### Abilities

- **Seasoned:** Starts with a set of armour and a weapon
- **Hollow Shell:** Damage taken is permanent.



## The Sorcerer

A mysterious scholar of the arcane arts who constantly hides beneath a **big hat.**

### Personal Story

In reality more swine herd than sorcerer, as his master died before they could complete their training. Extremely self-conscious about not having graduated their apprenticeship.

Literally haunted by the ghost of their dead master, though too scared to face him.

Has to grow to fill the shoes (or the hat in this case) of the person they are expecting themselves to be...while already fulfilling said role for the people around them. It's a good ol' coming of age story.

### Abilities

- **Jebrewsalem:** Familiar with alchemy.
- **Peasant Consultant:** Regularly get tasks from the town's inhabitants.
