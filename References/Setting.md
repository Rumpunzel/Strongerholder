# Setting

## Constraints the Setting has to fulfil

- Have a generally wholesome and enchanting atmosphere.
- Be low-tech or have a similar characteristic which requires labour to be manual and divided into individual steps &rarr;Â facilitate the need for a bunch of people to work together.
- The player, even though they ultimately have total control over how the town is constructed, should neither feel above nor below the NPCs co-inhabiting the town but rather a part of the community working to make the town the best place it can be.
- Be very personal and down-to-earth.
- Have a world to explore, discover, and mould.
- Be mostly devoid of time-pressure and encourage attention to detail.
- Have some sort of *-punk elements for spice and everything nice.
- Allowing setbacks to 'fail forward'.
- Be focused on solving conflicts with violence being a last and final option.

## Suggestions so far

- Have the game set in a medieval fantasy world inside an enchanted forest (with some Mediterranean influences).
- A great war ravaged the land and the people arriving in and building the town are in search of a new and better life. This also enables a very organic way of introducing more challenging scenarios with exploring the world.
